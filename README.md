# hello-world
Este repositório é para praticar o fluxo do GitHub. <br>
My name is Camila and I'm not new on code but it has been a long time since I've coded something from zero. <br>
I'm on a Microsoft Bootcamp in DIO and studying IA to merge & specialize my cultural studies with my technology skill.
